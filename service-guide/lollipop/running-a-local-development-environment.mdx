To develop smart contracts on Lollipop L2, it is necessary to create an L2 development environment. While setting the development environment for L1 (Ethereum) is relatively simple, using tools such as Ganache or hardhat-node, L2 development environment requires additional resources. This section explains how to create a Lollipop L2 development environment in a Linux-based environment.

Lollipop supports L2 network deployment through simple command execution. This allows users to easily manage the network without complicated setup tasks. In addition, Lollipop is highly scalable and flexible, allowing developers to adjust the network according to business requirements. These benefits will go a long way in helping developers build the IT infrastructure they need.
